This project aims to develop a chatbot assistant capable of maintaining friendly conversations and providing accurate answers about the content present on the Scalian company website.

## **Main Features:**

**Scraper for Content Download:**

- A scraper was designed to efficiently download the content of any web page with texts.
- The extracted content was subjected to an organization process to ensure the coherence and relevance of the information.
- The scraper was dockerized to encapsulate it in a standalone container. This approach offers portability, efficient dependency management, isolation, and improved security.
It facilitates deployment, scalability, resource control and version management, ensuring a consistent and efficient environment in various operational scenarios.

**Bot Development**

1. **Frontend with Reflex and Integrated Deployment:**
    - The frontend was developed using the Reflex framework, providing an intuitive user interface. Additionally, an integrated deployment process was implemented to facilitate system             implementation and upgrades.
2. **Backend Development with LangChain:**
 - Embeddings were generated from the organized content and stored in a FAISS vector database to facilitate fast and accurate searches during interactions with the chatbot.
 - Using the LangChain framework, a robust backend was created that manages chatbot requests, retrieving information from FAISS and connecting to the OpenAI API for contextual responses.
